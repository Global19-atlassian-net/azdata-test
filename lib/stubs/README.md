# Azure Data Studio Test Stubs

This folder contains a set of stub objects that can be used to provide stub implementations for various parts of the Azure Data Studio extensibility API which are difficult to test in extension unit tests or require control that is not normally available to extensions.

The stubs provided are not complete - if there is functionality missing that you think is generally useful to other extensions then please submit a PR to get it added here.
